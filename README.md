# Read EXIF & push data to Google Sheets
A python script to collect the EXIF data from photos and push it to Google Sheets.

*Disclaimer: some functions are customized based on my own photos and directories. Adjusting might be needed.*

Few things that need to be prepared:
* Adjust the `config_template.py`
* Service account credential from Google Cloud (`credentials.json`)
